# SigmaCode
This repository contains the code for workshops and stickers at SigmaCamp. The code is written in Python, and primarily generates Latex documents to be printed and used around camp. Additionally, some of the code uses the Google Sheets API to read and write information online spreadsheets.

This code serves two main functions:
- Generate stickers for SigmaStaff using information stored in the Master spreadsheet
- Assign campers to workshops based on their preferences and generate documents with information on workshops

Currently, work is being done to better automate these tasks and expand the degree of automation to save as much time as possible and reduce possible error.
